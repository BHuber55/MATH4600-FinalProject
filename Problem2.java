	 * 		Write a program to apply the modified newtons method to the equation f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4 = 0
	 * 		starting with x0 = 3. use m=1 and 2, and make separate numerical runs. In each case, set the maximum number of iterations to 25,
	 * 		but stop the computation when the backward error, i.e f(xn), is less than 10^-12. Print all intermediate points xn and backwards
	 * 		error f(xn). Verify the convergence rates of your numerical solutions in both cases. (For m=1, you should observe linear convergence.
	 * 		For m=2, you should get quadratic convergence.) Use double precision in your computation.
